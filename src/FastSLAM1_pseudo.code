particle = individiual state estimate + 1 kalman filter per map feature (total of N)
Particle filter: M particles

const M = 50
N = 0 to start, adding more as I go algon

# v1 (direct from book, bearing + range - color)
#  algorithm assumes known correspondences for now
#  color will make this known correspondences originally

for each particle:
